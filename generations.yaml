generations:
  - name: "First Generation (T200)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The original Chevrolet Aveo (initially marketed as Daewoo Kalos in some markets) was a subcompact car available in both sedan and five-door hatchback body styles. Designed by Italdesign, it featured relatively conservative styling with a focus on practicality and affordability. Powertrain options included various small-displacement engines ranging from 1.2L to 1.6L producing between 70-110 HP, paired with either manual or automatic transmissions. The interior was basic but functional, with an emphasis on space efficiency rather than premium features. Safety equipment was minimal by modern standards, though later models received upgrades in some markets. A facelift in 2007 updated the styling and introduced the Aveo5 hatchback name in North America. This generation was developed by Daewoo before GM's acquisition of the Korean company, and represented GM's entry-level offering in many global markets."

  - name: "Second Generation (T300)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The second-generation Aveo (marketed as Sonic in North America and Australia) was designed under GM's global development program and represented a significant upgrade over its predecessor. The exterior featured more dynamic styling with motorcycle-inspired headlights, hidden rear door handles on the hatchback, and a more contemporary overall design. Built on GM's Gamma II platform, it offered improved driving dynamics and safety features. Engine options included 1.2L to 1.8L gasoline engines and 1.3L diesel variants in some markets, with the North American models featuring a 1.8L naturally aspirated or 1.4L turbocharged engine. The interior quality improved substantially with better materials, available smart features, and increased technology options including touchscreen infotainment in later models. Safety enhancements included multiple airbags and electronic stability control. This generation elevated the Aveo/Sonic from a basic economy car to a more competitive subcompact with appealing features and improved refinement."

    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The current generation, primarily designed for emerging markets, is based on the GEM (Global Emerging Markets) platform developed by SAIC-GM-Wuling. In some markets, this vehicle is a rebadged version of the Baojun 310 or Chevrolet Onix depending on the region. The design features modern Chevrolet styling elements with a large grille, swept-back headlights, and a more contemporary overall appearance. Engine options typically include small-displacement, fuel-efficient units around 1.0L to 1.5L with both naturally aspirated and turbocharged options. The interior offers improved connectivity with touchscreen infotainment systems supporting smartphone integration, while safety features have been upgraded to include multiple airbags and electronic stability control as standard in most markets. This generation is not sold in North America, where the Aveo/Sonic was discontinued. The third-generation Aveo represents Chevrolet's continued focus on providing affordable transportation in global markets with improved technology and safety features compared to previous generations."
